# Fingerprint ID and Keypad Lockbox
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was getting the keypad and RGB LED up and running with the Arduino! So I first tinkered around to make create a code that worked with the keypad. Each number or letter button on the 4 x 4 keypad was expressed by the input of two different pins on the Arduino. Using arrays, the keys of the keypad were
